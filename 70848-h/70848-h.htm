Iupiter, &amp; Hercules, yea our Englāde

the foure generall monarchyes of the Assyrianes,
Perseanes, Grekes, and Romanes.
Some haue attrybuted it, to the bolde

of Babylon the first inuētour of polycyes
in warre, in our great Albion the
Chamesene, whych first in thys regyon

defaced of hym the tyrannouse yssue, in

<p>The hawty Romanes set not yet a

of Aeneas &amp; Romulus, of whom the one
most shamefully betrayed hys owne natyue
kyndred and contraye, and the other
most vnnaturally slewe hys owne brother
for worldly domynyō. Lyke as our walshemen
here in Englande, aduaūcynge their
successyon or progeny aboue the Englysh
wyll nedes come of Sardanus &amp; Bute, a
foūdacyō not all vnlyke to the other. These
gloryouse champyons for thys farre fatched
groūde of their Nobylyte, accoūte all
other nacyons and peoples, ignoble, profane,
and barbarouse, as is to be seane in
the monumētes of their writers. But in
the meaneseason, they are not aware that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[fol. 3]</span>
they wndyscretely prefarre cursed Cham
to blessed Iaphet, by whose posteryte the
Iles of the Gentyles were first sorted out
in to speches, kyndredes, and nacyons, Gene.
10. and not by Chams ofsprynge, of
whome the Troianes and Romanes had
their noble begynnynge. That the Chamesenes
had in those Iles, was by cruell vsurpacyon
&amp; tyrāny, as testyfyeth Berosus
the Caldeane and therfor that groūde
of Nobylyte is not all the best. Ouer and
besydes all thys, some haue applyed it to
renomed byrth or successyon of bloude, some
to the habūdaūce of pleasures worldly
some to the mayntenaūce of great famylyes,
some to the sūptuousnesse of notable
buyldynges, some to the hygh stomake &amp;
stature of persone, some to valeaūtnesse
in marcyall feates, some to semely maners
of courtesye, some to lyberalyte of rewardes
and gyftes, some to the auncyentnesse
of longe coūtynuaunce, some to wysdome

<div class="sidenote">Fryres.</div>

<p>But now foloweth, a monstruouse, or
whether ye wyll, a prestygyouse nobylyte.
The Romysh clergye ymagenynge to exalte
themselues aboue the lewde layte
(as they shame not yet to call the worldly
powers) haue geuen it in a farre other
kynde, to mytars, masses, Cardynall hattes,
crosers, cappes, shauen crownes, oyled
thombes, syde gownes, furred amyses, mōkes
cowles, and fryres lowsy coates, becōmynge
therby pōtyfycall lordes, spirytuall
sirs, and ghostly fathers. Thys kynde
of Nobylyte dygged out of the dongehyll,
haue I seane gorgyously garnyshed
with the retoryckes of Porphyry, Aristotle,
Duns, and Raymundus decretals, in
the bokes of Iohan Stanbery byshopp of
herforde, De superioritate ecclesiastica,
De discrimine iurisdictionum, and De
potestate pōtificia. In the bokes also of
Walter hūte an ordynary reader sūtyme
in Oxforde, De precellētia Petri, &amp; De
autoritate ecclesie. Yea, and amōge thēselues
they haue moch contended both by
disputacyon &amp; writynges, whych of their
seeres myght other excell in the nobylnesse
of christen perfection. The monkes
in publyque scoles, by a dystynccyon of the
actyue and contemplatyue lyfe, haue
aduaunced their ydell mōkery aboue the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[fol. 4]</span>
offyce of a byshopp, and the fryres their
scalde crauynge beggery, aboue the degrees
of thē Both. As is largely seane in
the brawlynge workes of Rycharde Maydeston,
Thomas walden, Wyllyam Byntre
&amp; other whych haue written Contra
wicleuistas, &amp; Pro mēdicatione fratrū.</p>

<div class="sidenote">O Deuils īcarnate.</div>

<p>In the dayes of kynge Edwarde the
fourt, Iohan Myluerton prouyncyall of
the Carmelytes, was full thre yeares, a
prysoner in the castell of Angell at Rome
at the sute of the byshoppes of Englande
for the same, and lost so the byshopryck of
saynt Dauids, wherunto he was a lyttle
afore elected. Thys matter haue I hearde,
vndre the tyttle of Euangelyck perfeccyon,
most depely reasoned in their ordynary
dysputacions at their concourses
cōuocacyons, and chapters (as they than
called them) yea by those whome I knewe
most corrupt lyuers, Berūto for fournyshynge
out the same, the graye fryres
added. S. frances paynted woūdes, the
blacke fryres. S. Domynyckes bolde dysputynge
with heretykes, the whyte fryres
our ladyes fraternyte, and the Augustyne
fryres the great doctryne of their
patrone. In the vnyuersytees afte moch
to and fro, hath it bene concluded, that
the order of a prest haue farre excelled in
dygnyte the order of a byshopp. And thys
haue they left behynde them for a most
graue and depe reason therupon. Marke
their more than lucyferyne presumpcyon
therin. Soch power hath a prest (saye
they) as hath neyther Angell nor yet
Man, be he of neuer so great autoryte,
scyēce, or vertu. For a prest by worde maye
make hym agayne, that by worde made
heauen &amp; earth. A prest maye euery daye
both byget hym and beare hym, where as
hys mother Marye bygate hym (beare
hym they wolde saye) but ones. These are
their very wordes in a boke entytled, De
origine Nobilitatis. ca. 5. with moch more
cyrcumstaunce of matter. O blasphemouse
bellybeastes, &amp; most ydell wytted
sorcerers. How ydolatrously exalte they
themselues aboue the eternall lyuynge
God &amp; hys Christ?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nobylyte.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Apostles.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Faythe.</div>

<p>Iohan Chrisostome a man taught and
brought up in the christen philosophy, defyneth
the true Nobylyte after a farre
other sort, than ded the prophane writers.
He calleth it not with Aristotle, a
worthynesse of progeny, neyther yet with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[fol. 5]</span>
Varro ā opulēcy of ryches, but a fameuse
renome obtayned by lōge exercysed vertu.
He is pusaunt, hygh, ād valeaunt (sayth
he) and hath Nobylyte in right course,
that dysdayneth to geue place to vyces
and abhorreth to be ouercomen of them.
Doctryne greatly adourneth a mā hyghly
borne, but a godly endeuoure of christyanyte
bewtyfyeth hym most of all. By nō
other wayes haue the Apostles and Martyrs
obtayned a noble report, than by the
valeaunt force of pure doctryne and fayth.
A gētyll hart (sayth Seneca) or a stomake
that ys noble, moueth, prouoketh, and
sturreth, only to thynges honest. No man
whych hath a noble wytte, delyteth in
thynges of small value, moch lesse in matters
of fylthynesse or supperstycyon. Chefely
apperteyneth it to men and women
of syncere Nobylyte, to regarde the pure
doctryne and faythe, vnto soch hath God
promysed in the scriptures, habundaunce
of tēporall thynges, longe lyfe, fortunate
chyldren, a kyngedome durable, with soch
other, Deut. 28.</p>

<p>A most worthy conquerour is Gedeon

of faythe. Iudi. vj. So is kynge Asa, for
remouynge the male stues from the prelates
abhorrynge marryage, &amp; for puttynge
downe ydolles whych hys forefathers
maynteyned. 3. Reg. 15. So is kynge Iosaphat,
for beynge couragyouse in the wayes
of God, and for puttynge downe the
hyll aulters &amp; their sacrifices. 2. parali
17. So is kynge Iehu, for sleynge the ydolatrouse
Prestes, and for breakynge and
burnynge their great God Baal, and for
makynge, a Iakes of their holy churche
4. Reg. 10. So is kynge Ezechias for clēsynge
the house of the lorde from all fylthynesse,
afore hys tyme therin occupyed.
2. Parali. 29. and for breakynge downe
the brasen serpent and ydolatrouse ymages
with their aulters and sanctuaryes.
4. Reg. 18. So is kynge Iosias, for suppressynge
relygyouse persones and aulter prestes,
for cōsumynge their iewels &amp; ornamētes,
&amp; for ouerthrowynge their buggery
chambers in the howse of the lorde
4. Reg. 23. Thys noble kīge also destroyed
all theyr carued ymages, he strewed the
dust of thē vpon their graues that had
offered to them, and brent the prestes bones
vpō their aulters, restorynge agayne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[fol. 6]</span>

<p>Not I only, but many thousandes more
whych wyll not from hens fourth bowe
any more to Baal, are in full &amp; perfyght
hope, that all these most hyghly notable
and pryncely actes, wyll reuyue &amp; lyuely
florysh in your most noble and worthy
brother kynge Edwarde the sixt. Most
excellent &amp; godly are hys begynnynges
reported of the very foren nacyōs callynge
hym for hys vertuouse, lerned, and godly
prudent youthes sake, the seconde Iosias.
Those hys wonderfull pryncyples in the
eyes of the worlde, and no lesse gloryouse
afore God thus beynge to hys honoure,
that eternall lyuynge God contynue and
prospere to the ende, that he maye haue
of them as had these vorthy kinges afore
rehearced, a ryght noble and famouse report.
Nobylyte sought by wycked enterpryses
and obtayned by the same (as in
many afore our dayes, and in some now
of late) is not els but a publyque and
notable infamye, and in the ende eternall
dāpnacyon. Nobylyte wonne by the ernest
sekynge of Gods hygh honour, is soch a
precyouse crowne of glory as wyll neuer
perysh here nor yet in the worlde to come.</p>

<p>Cain after a worldly maner, or amōge
the vngracyouse sort, is holden noble for
slaynge hys brother Iudas of the prelates
(for he receyued of thē, a noble rewarde)
for betrayenge Christ, Herode of the Iewes
for murtherynge the innocētes. And
what is there more worthy reproche, dyshonour,
and shame, than are these execrable
factes? The nature of true Nobylyte
(as I haue sayd afore) is not to ryse
of vyce but of vertu, though many men
there seke it. Of the most excellēt kinde of
Nobylyte is he sure (most vertuouse and
lerned lady) whych truly beleueth and seketh
to do the wyll of the eternall father,
for therby is he brought forewarde, and
promoted into that heauenly kyndred
Ioā. 1. By that meanes becometh he the
deare brother, syster, &amp; mother of Christ

<p>Of thys Nobylyte, haue I no doubt
(lady most faythfully studyouse) but that
yow are, with many other noble women &amp;
maydēs more in thys blessed age. If questyon
were axt me, how I knowe it? my
answere wolde be thys. By your godly
frute, as the fertyle tre is non other wyse
than therby knowne, Luce. vj. I receyued
your noble boke, ryght frutefully of yow
translated out of the frenche tunge into
Englysh. I receyued also your golden sentences
out of the sacred scriptures, with
no lesse grace than lernynge in foure noble
lāguages, Latyne, Greke, Frenche, &amp;
Italyane, most ornately, fynely, &amp; purely
writtē with your owne hande. Wonderfully
ioyouse were the lerned men of our
cytie, Murseus, Buscoducius, Bomelius,
Lithodius &amp; Imānus, as I shewed vnto
them the seyd sentences, in beholdynge
(as they than reported) so moch vertu,
faythe, scyence, &amp; experyēce of lāguages
&amp; letters, specyally in noble youth &amp; femynyte.
Through whych occasyon there
be of thē (I knowe) that can not witholde
their lerned handes frō the publyshynge
therof, to the hygh prayse of God the
geuer, neyther yet from wrytynge to your
worthy grace for studyouse contynuaunce
in the same. Your seyd sētēces, they saye
farre passeth the Apohthegmes of Plutarchus,
the Aphorismes of Theognis, the
Stratagemes of Isocrates, the graue golden
coūsels of Cato &amp; the manyfolde morals

so corrupt they are in their vayne coniectures,
and so abhomynable in their dayly

is godly. By thys do your grace vnto vs
sygnyfye, that the baren doctryne &amp; good
workes without fayth of the hypocrytes,

serue their bellyes &amp; not Christ,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[fol. 8]</span>
in gredyly deuourynge the patrymony of
poor wydowes &amp; orphanes, are both execrable
in themselues, and abhomynable
afore God for though those paynted sepulchres
haue the name of the lorde in
their mouthes, &amp; greatly boast the good
workes of the lawe, yet knowe they not
what belongeth to hys true honoure, but
hate in their wycked hartes both hys
gloryouse name and worde. The true doctryne
of faythe, and the feare of God,
wyll that wycked sort (whome thys psalme
wryngeth) not heare, but styll tormēt
the conscyences of myserable wretched
ydyotes for aduauntage of Masses and
momblynges. Happy are they of thys latter
age, that in the Gospell haue receyued

the only good grace of the almyghty God
whych is neuer slacke to preuent vs with

that whych hath ouercome all synne.
O my lorde what grace and goodnesse is
thys, whych doth put out so manye synnes.
Now maye we se that thu art full of all
godly loue to make me of a synner, thy seruaūt
&amp; chyelde. Alas my God, I ded not
seke the but I fled &amp; rāne awaye frō the.
And here beneth thu camyst to me whych
am nothynge but a worme of the earthe,
all naked. What do I saye, worme? I do
hym wrōge, that am so naughtye, &amp; swarme
so full of pryde, deceyte, malyce &amp; treason.
The promyse whych my fryndes made
whā I was baptysed is such, that I alwayes
through faythe in thy passyō shuld
fele the mortyfycacyō of my fleshe &amp; dwelle

&amp; through pryde, I haue lyft vp my wyll
in suche a maner, that through slouth, my
dewtye towardes the was forgoten. And
that moche more is, as wele the profyte or
value of thy promyse, whych I had of the
in the daye of my baptysme, as also thy
sauynge loue and promyses folowynge, I
haue all alyke neglected. What shall I
saye more? Albeit that often tymes thu
perceyuynge me wretched and vnhappye
hast geuē me so many warnynges in fayth
and in sacramētes, admonyshynge me by
preachynges, and confortynge me by the
recayuynge of thy worthye bodye and sacred
bloude, promysynge also to put me in
the nombre of them that are now adourned
with perfyght innocencye. Yet haue
I all these hygh benefyghtes, throwne

<div class="sidenote">Hiere. 7.</div>

<p>Often tymes haue I with the broken

sowle was to moche fed with euyll breade
or dāpnable doctryne of hypocrytes, I despysed
such socoure and ghostly physyck
in Gods worde as wolde haue holpe me.
And if I had bene wyllynge to loke for it
yet knewe I at that tyme no teachers cōuenyent.
For there is neyther man, saynte,
nor Angell, for whome the harte of a synner
without thy sprete wyll change. Alas
good Iesus, thu beholdynge my blyndenesse,
and that at my neade I coulde haue
no socour of men, dedyst open the waye of
my saluacyon. O how great is the goodnesse,
and how inestymable the swetnesse
whych thu hast shewed therin? Is there
any father so naturall to the daughter
or brother to the syster, whych wolde euer
haue done as he hath done? For he came
into the helle to socour my sowle, where
agaynst hys wyll she was, intendynge to

that so louest euery synner, yea, and also
thyne enemyes, not only in forgeuynge
their offences, but also in geuynge thy selfe
for their saluacyon, lybertie, and delyueraunce,

payne and sufferaunce. Whan I cast in
mynde, what shulde be the occasyō of thy

but a loue wonderfull, whych moueth the
to geue me that I can not deserue. Than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[fol. 14]</span>
my God as farre fourth as I can se, I
ought to geue no thākes for my saluacyon
but only vnto the, to whome I owe the
prayse ther of, as to hym whych is my sauyour

that thu hast done so moche for me? Thu
art not only contented to haue forgyuen
me my synnes, but also hast gyuē vnto me
the ryght fortunate gifte of grace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roma. [unreadable].</div>

<div class="sidenote">Math. 12.</div>

<p>For it shulde suffyse me, I cōmynge
out of suche a daunger, to be lyke a straunger
vsed. But thu dost handle my sowle,
(if I durst so saye it) as a mother, daughter,
syster and wyfe. I lorde, I am the
trespaser whych am not worthy to come
nere the dore of thy ryght hygh place to
aske breade, where thy dwellynge is. O
what grace is thys, that so sodenly thu
vouchesauyst to drawe my sowle in to
suche hyghnesse, that she felyth her selfe
ruler of my bodye. She poore, ignoraunte
and lame, doth fynde her selfe wyth the,
ryche, wyse, and stronge, because thu hast
written in her harte the roote of thy sprete,
&amp; holy worde, geuynge her true fayth
for to receyue it. Whych thynge made her
to conceyue thy sonne, in beleuynge hym
to be man, God, sauyour, and also the true
remytter of synnes. Therfor dost thu assure
her, that she is mother to thy sonne
of whom thu art the only faither.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Phil. 2.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gene. 1.</div>

<p>And farthermore, O my father here is
a great loue, for thu art not wery of wele
doynge syth that thy sonne full of dyuynyte
hath taken the bodye of a man, &amp; ded
myngle hymselfe with our ashes, whych
thynge a man can not vnderstāde vnlesse
he hath a true faythe. It hath pleased the
to put hym so neare vs, that he ded ioyne
hymselfe vnto our fleshe. Than we seynge
hym to be called man, we are bolde to call
hym syster and brother. Now the sowle
whych maye saye of her selfe, that she is
the syster of God, ought to haue her harte
assured. After thys dost thu declare with
greate loue, how her creacyon is only of
the good wyll, whych it pleaseth the alwayes
to haue towardes her, geuynge assuraunce
that before her first daye, or tyme
of beynge prouyded for her, thu bestowedest
thy loue on her, &amp; how through loue
thu hast made her (as alone of power thu
cannyst wele do it) and also how thu
dedyst put her within thys body, not for to
sleape with slouth, but that both of them
shulde haue non other exercyse, but only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[fol. 15]</span>
to thynke how to do some seruyce vnto the.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tren. 2.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Colos. 2.</div>

<p>Than the truthe maketh her to feale
that there is in the, true paternyte. O
what honoure, what swetnesse, and what
glory hath the sowle, whych doth alwayes
remēber that she is thy daughter, &amp;
in callynge the fayther, she doth thy commaundement?
What is there more? Is
that all? No, It doth please the to gyue
her an other name, to call her thy wyfe, &amp;
that she agayne do call the husbande,
declarynge how thu hast frely manyfested
the marryage of her. By the baptysme
thu hast made a promes, to gyue her thy
goodes and ryches, and thu agayne to take
her synnes, for she hath nothynge els
by herytage of her first father Adam. All
her treasures, that she hath of nature, are
nothynge els but synnes, whych thu hast
tyed vpon the, and payed all her whole
debte with thy goodes and landes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ioā. 5.</div>

<p>Thu hast made her so ryche, and with

her selfe to be thy woyd wyfe, doth
beleue to be quytt of all that she oweth,
estemynge very lytel that she hath here
beneth. She forsaketh her olde father, &amp;
all the goodes that he gyueth, for her
husbandes sake. Surely (o my God) my
sowle is sore hurte to be fedde with suche
good, and agayne releued in leauynge the
pleasure of thys worlde for that whych
is eternall, where peace is without warre.
I maruayle that she, thys remembrynge,
doth not lese her witt, coūtenaunce,
and speache. Father, father, alas what
ought I to thynke. Shall my sprete be so
bolde as to take vpon hym to call the father?
Yea, and also our Father, for so hast
thu taught in the Pater noster. But to
call the daughter, hast thu so sayd? I besyche
the, tell me. Alas yea, whan with
great swetnesse, thu saydest daughter,
lend me thy harte.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apoca. 13.</div>

<p>O my God, in stede of lendynge, he is
ready to geue hym selfe wholly vnto the.
Receyue hym than, &amp; do not permyt that
any creature put hym from the, so that
for euer with faythfull stedefastnesse he
maye loue the with a daughterly loue.
Now my lorde if thu be my father, maye
I thynke that I can be thy mother? Indede
I can not wele preceyue, how I
shulde conceyue the that createdyst me.
But thu dedyst in thys matter satisfye
my doubte, whan in preachynge and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[fol. 16]</span>
streatchynge fourth thy hādes dedyst saye
Those that shall do the wyll of my father
they are my bretherne, also my syster and
mother. I beleue than, that hearynge &amp;
readynge the wordes whych thu hast
taught &amp; vttered by thy holy prophetes,
the same also whych through thy true preachers,
thu dost dayly declare vnto mē in
beleuynge it and stedefastly desyerynge
to fulfyll, I cōceyue the &amp; beare the by loue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Math. 1.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1. Cor. 15.</div>

<p>Therfor without āye feare, wyll I take
vpō me the name of a mother. What mother
of God? O swete vyrgyne Marye, I
besyche the, be not angry that I take vp
suche a tytle. I do neyther stele, nor vsurpe
any thynge vpon thy pryuylege. For thu
only hast aboue all womē receyued of hym
so great honoure, that nomā can in hymselfe
comprehende how he hath bene wyllynge
to take in the our fleshe. For thu arte
mother and perfyght vyrgyne before
and after, and in hys holy byrth. In thy
blessyd wombe thu dedyst beare hym and
norysh hym. Thu dedyst folowe hym in
hys trybulacyons, and also in hys teachynges.
Now breuely to conclude. Thu hast
with God founde suche grace, as the
enemye through malyce and deceyte,
had caused Adam &amp; hys posteryte to lose.
By Eue and hym we had lost it, &amp; by thy
sonne hath it bene yelded vnto vs agayne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Luce. 1.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Acto. 12.</div>

<p>Therfor hast thu bene ryghteously called
full of grace. For thu lackedyst neyther
grace nor vertu, sith that he whych is
the best amonge them that be good, also
the sprynge of all goodnesse and power
whych hath created in the so pure innocēcye
that thu arte the example of all uertues,
hath buylded in the hys dwellynge &amp;
temple. He through loue ded conforme
hymselfe with the, and thu arte transfourmed
in hym. Therfor if any man shulde
thynke to geue the greatter prayse than
God hymselfe hath done, it were a fule
blasphemye. For there is no suche prayse,
as is the same whych commeth from God.
Thu also hast had faythe so fyrme and cōstaunt,
that (by grace) she had the power
to make the godly. Wherfor I wyll not take
vpon me, to geue the greatter prayse
than the honoure whych thy souerayne
lorde hath geuen vnto the. For thu arte
hys corporall mother, and also through
fayth hys spyrytuall mother.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roma. 8[unclear].</div>

<div class="sidenote">Canti. 4.</div>

<p>And I folowynge thy fayth with humblenesse,
am hys spirytuall mother also.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[fol. 17]</span>
Alas my God the brotherlynesse that thu
hast towardes me through thy humblenesse,
in callynge me syster, is great. Dedyst
thu euer saye ī it any thynge afore?
Alas yea. For thu hast broken the kyndred
of my olde father, callynge me doughter
by adopcyon. Well than, seynge that we
haue both but one father, I wyll not feare
to call the my brother. For so hast thu reported
it by Salomon in hys bellet, saynge,
My syster and spouse thu hast wounded
my harte with the swete loke of one
of thyne eyes, and with one cheyne of thy
necke. Alas my brother, I wyshe for nothynge
els, but that in woūdynge the, I
myght fynde my selfe wounded with thy
loue. To that wolde I geue ouer my selfe.
And lyke wyse thu dost call me wyfe in
that place, shewynge largely that thu louyst
me, saynge by these wordes amorouse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canti. 2.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Luce. 8.</div>

<p>Aryse my dere doue, and come hytherwarde
my dylectable spouse. Therfor shal
I saye with louynge fayth, thu arte myne
and I am thyne. Thu dost call me thy loue
&amp; fayre spouse. If it be so, suche hast thu
made me. Alas, doth it please the, to gyue
me suche names? They are truly able to
breake a mannys harte, and cause it to
burne through loue vnspeakeable, whan
he thynketh vpon the honoure that thu
dost vnto hym, whych is moche greatter
than he hath deserued. A mother, a mother?
Alas but of what chylde is it? Truly
of suche a sonne, that my harte doth breake
for loue. My God, my sonne? O Iesus
what speache thys is, mother, daughter.
O happy kynrede. O what swetnesse doth
proceade out of that paternyte. But what
doughterly and reuerent feare ought I
to haue towardes hym, my father, yea &amp;
my creatour, my protectour and sauer? To
be thy syster, alas here is a great loue.</p>

<p>Now dost thu breake my harte ī the myddest
to make rowme for the same so swete
a brother. So that no other name be writē
in the same, but only my brother Iesus
the sonne of God. Non other man wyll I
geue place to, for all the scourgynge and
beatynge, that they cā do vnto me. Reape
my harte then, my brother and frynde, &amp;
lete not thy enemy entre into it. O my father,
chylde, brother, and spouse, with handes
ioyned, humbly vpon my knees I yelde
the thankes and prayses, that it pleaseth
the to turne thy face towardes me
conuertynge my harte, and coueryng me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[fol. 18]</span>
with suche grace, that thu dost se nomore
my euyls &amp; synnes. So wele hast thu hydden
them, that it semeth, thu hast put thē
in forgetfulnesse. Yea, &amp; also they seme
to be forgoten of me, whych haue cōmytted
them, for fayth and loue causeth me to
forget them, puttynge wholly my trust

<p>Than my father, in whom lyeth vnfayned
loue, wherof can I haue feare in my
harte? I confesse that I haue done all
the euyll that one creature can do, and
that of my selfe I am nought. Also that
I haue offended the as the prodygall chylde
ded, folowynge the folysh trade of the
fleshe, wherewith I haue spente all my
substaūce, and the habundaūce of goodes
whych I had receyued of the. For pouerte
had wetheryd me awaye euen as heye
and yelded my sprete dead for hunger, seakynge
to eate the releafe of swyne. But
I founde very lytle sauoure in suche meates.
Than I seynge my lyfe to be so myserable,
I ded returne vnto the my father agayne,
sayenge. Alas I haue synned in heauen
and before the. I am not worthy (I
tell it before euerybodye) to be called thy
chylde. But O bountyfull father, do no
worse to me, than to one of thy howsholde
seruauntes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Luce. 15.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Esa[unclear]. 27.</div>

<p>Alas what loue and zele is thys? for
thu woldest not tarry my commynge and
prayer but stretchynge out thy hāde receyuedyst
me, whan I ded thynke that thu
woldest not loke vpon me. And in stede to
haue ponnyshed, thu dedyst assure me of
my saluacyon. Where is he thē that shall
ponnysh me, whan my father shall denye
hym my synne? There is no iudge that
can condēpne anye creature, vnlesse God
hymselfe wolde dampne hym. I feare not
the want of goodnesse, syth I haue my
God for my father. My enemye shall do
me no harme, for my father shall take all
hys strength awaye. If I owe anye thynge,
he shall paye it all for me, If I haue

<div class="sidenote">Roma. 7.</div>

<p>But here is the worst. What maner of
mother haue I been? For after that I by
fayth, had receyued the name of a true
mother, I became very rude vnto the, by
cause that after I had conceyued and
brought the fourth, I left reason. And
beynge subiect to my wyll, not takynge
heade vnto the, I fell a slepe and gaue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[fol. 19]</span>
place to my great enemye. The whych ī the
nyght of ignoraunce, I beynge a sleape
ded steale the from me craftely, and in thy
place, she ded put her chylde whych was
dead. So ded I lese the, whych is an harde
sorowe and remorce for me. Now haue
I lost the by myne owe faulte (my sonne)
bycause I toke no hede to kepe the. Sensualyte
my neyghbour (I beynge in my
beastly sleape) ded steale the from me, &amp;
gaue me, an other chylde whych had no
lyfe in hym, named synne, whom I wyll
not haue, for I do vtterly forsake hym.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Cor. 6[unclear].</div>

<div class="sidenote">3. Reg. 3.</div>

<p>She affirmed that he was myne owne
but I knewe hym to be hers. For as sone
as I came to the lyght of grace, whych
thu haddest gyuē me, thā I knewe my glory
to be changed, whan I sawe the dead
chylde not to be myne. For the same whych
was alyue (whom she had taken awaye)
was myne owne. Betwene Iesus &amp; synne
is the chaunge so apparant. But here is a
straunge thynge. Thys olde woman causeth
me to kepe hym whych is dead, whom
she reporteth to be myne, and so she wyll
maynteyne. O Salomō, a full true iudge,
thu hast hearde thys lamentable processe
and ordayned to cōtent the partyes, that
the chylde shulde be deuyded in two partes.
The false woman agreyth, it shulde
be so. But I remembrynge hym to be myne
owne sonne, was rather contente to
lese hym, than to se hys bodye parted in
two peces. For true and perfyght loue is
neuer contente with one halfe of that it
doth loue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2[unclear]. Cor. 4.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sapi. 3.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gene. 6.</div>

<p>I had rather to wepe for my whole
losse, than to recouer but one halfe. My
mynde coulde not be satysfyed, if I had
recouered one halfe without lyfe. Alas
gyue her rather the chylde whych is alyue.
Better it is for me to dye, than to se Iesus
Christ dyuyded. But O my lorde, thu dedyst
loke better to it than I. For thu seynge
the anguysh that I ded suffer, &amp; how
I ded rather forsake my ryght, than to
beholde suche cruelnesse Thu saydest, thys
is the true mother and so caused them to
gyue me my chylde agayne, for whom my
harte was so sorowfull. O swete Iesus, I
founde the after, to haue proued me if I
ded loue the. Yea, I whych had lost the
yet dedyst thu returne vnto me. Alas dost
thu vouchesaue to come agayne to her,
whych beynge lett with synne coulde not
kepe the, my swete chylde, my sonne, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[fol. 20]</span>
helper, my norysher, of whome I am a
ryght humble creature. Do not permytt
that euer I do leaue the agayne, for I do
repent my selfe of the tyme passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Esa. 32.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Psal. 118.</div>

<p>Now come my sensualyte with synnes
of all qualytees, for thu hast no power to
make me receyue the chylde whych is dead.
The same that I haue is stronge ynough
for to defende me, &amp; he shall not
permyt that thu take hym awaye from
me. He is alredy more stronge than anye
man is. Therfor I maye sleape and take
rest neare hym. For all thynges wele consydered,
he shall kepe me moche better
than I coulde hym. Then as I thynke I
maye take rest. O swete rest of the mother
&amp; the sonne togyther, my swete chylde.
O my God, honoure &amp; prayse be vnto
the only, so that euery creature maye se
how it hath pleased the to call me a mother,
lesse than nothynge. The more that
the thynge is straunge and harde to be
done, the more ought thy goodnesse to haue
prayse for it. And also I fynde my selfe
more bounde vnto the than euer I ded for
thys, that it pleaseth the to haue retayned
me for thy syster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nume. 12.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Deute. 5.</div>

<p>I am syster vnto the but so naughty a
syster, that better it were for me, that I
were without the name, for I forgate
the honoure of adopcyon in so noble a kyndred,
&amp; also thy so good &amp; brotherly behauer
towardes me. I with pryde ded
ryse agaynst the and, not remembrynge
my faultes, but goynge astraye from the,
ded agree with my brother Aaron, beynge
in wyll to geue iudgment agaynst thy

also, whych thynge causeth me to haue a
great remorce in my conscyence. Alas

Moses, whych doist all with goodnesse
and Iustyce. I haue estemed thy workes
to be euen synne, beynge so bolde to speake
euyn rashely, saynge, Wherfor hast thu
marryed a straunge woman? Thu gyuest
vs a lawe, and ponnyshemente if we do

thu tokest thy wyfe amonge them. Alas
my dere brother, with a great meany of
soche wordes (whom I knowe to be
folyshe) with Aaron (whych is my owne
wytte) I imbrayded the, Wherof I do repente.
For the lyuely voyce of God, rebukyngly
toke me vp, before I wente out of
the place. What woldest thu than of my
synne? Alas my brother thu woldest not
haue me ponnyshed, but rather woldest
my saluacyon and helthe, in askynge for
me, thys great benefyght, that it shulde
please God to mytygate hys iudgemente.
The whych thynge thu couldest not obtayne.
For I became a lazar, so that whan
any body shulde loke vpō me, they myght
wele se that I had not bene wyse. And so
was I put out from the tentes and tabernacles
of the people, bycause that a sycke

<p>Oh, a sowle can not haue a greatter

of the cumpanye of them whych are holye

my repentaunce? Thu prouydedyst that
my penaunce was sone at an ende, and
with true loue dedyst make meanes for
me, wherupon I ded returne. O what
a brother wolde, instede to ponnyshe hys
folysh syster, so naturally cleaue vnto
her? For iniurye, grudge, &amp; great offēce,
thu geuyst her grace &amp; loue in recōpēce.
Alas my brother how excedynge is thys
thy loue? Moch more is it, than brotherhede
is bounde to geue to so poore &amp; wretched
a woman as I am. I haue done the
euyll, and thu geuyst me good for it, I am
thyne, and thu sayest, thu arte myne. Euē
so I am, and wyll be so for euer. I feare
nomore the great folyshenesse of Aaron,
for nomā maye separat me frō the. Now
that we are brother &amp; syster togyther, I
care very lytle for all other men. Thy landes

ded sende thē home agayne to their owne

their dyuerse complexyons. The ende of
their pretence is ponnyshment, and the
least harme that euer I coulde perceyue
in pōnyshynge thē, is thys, that they wolde
neuer se thē agayne. Thu shuldest rather
make the skye to turne thā, so to forsake
thy wyfe for her mysdoynge. Wherfor
my God, I can fynde nomā to be cōpared
vnto the. For of loue thu arte the perfect

one haue, than to be in the place of thy
wyfe, whych swetely taketh her rest so nere
the. Of all thy goodes quene, mastres,

so vyle a creature, am so ennoblyshed by

&amp; better than any man mortall can

sygh alwayes, and with habundaunce

I wyll tell now. Shall, or dare I tell it?

<p>O my sauer, whych dyed &amp; was crucyfyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[fol. 23]</span>
on the crosse for my synnes. Thys dede
is not suche, as a father to leaue hys
sonne, or as a chylde to offēde hys mother
or els as a syster to grudge &amp; chyde. Alas
thys is worse. For the offence is greatter
where more loue &amp; knowledge is. For
the more famylyaryte we haue with God
&amp; the more benefytes we receyue of hym
the greatter is our offēce whan we with
hym dyssemble. Specyally that I shuld
so do, whych am called hys spouse, and loued
of the as thyne owne sowle. Shall I
tell the truthe? Yea. I haue lefte the, forgoten
the, &amp; ranne awaye from the. I
ded leaue the for to go at my vayne pleasure.
I forsoke the and chose other. Yea, I
refused the, the welsprynge of all goodnesse

<div class="sidenote">Hebre. 12.</div>

bewtie, goodnesse, wysdom, and power, &amp;
sought to withdrawe me from thy loue.
I haue accepted thy great enemyes, that
is the deuyll, the worlde, and the fleshe,
agaynst whōe thu faughtest so sore on the
crosse, to ouercome for my sake, to set me
at lyberte, whych was by thē of lōge tyme
a prysoner slaue. And so bounde, that no
man coulde cause me to humble my selfe.
And as for the loue &amp; charyte that I shulde
haue had towardes the, they ded quēche
it so that the name of Iesus my husbāde,
whych before I had founde so swete,
was to me tedyouse &amp; hatefull. So that
often tymes I ded iest at it. And if any

to go at my pleasure. Now breuely to conclude,
All that thu dedyst forbyd me, I
fulfylled &amp; all that thu cōmaūdedyst me

<p>O most true husbāde, &amp; pure perfyght
frynde, the most louynge yet amonge all
good louers. Alas thu hast done otherwyse.
For thu soughtest for me dylygenly,
whan I was goynge into the most depe
place of helle, where all the euyls are done.
Whan I was fardest from the both
in harte and mynde, &amp; clerlye out of
the true waye. Than dedyst thu louynglye
call me backe, saynge, My dere doughter
harken, and se, and bowe thy
hearynge towardes me. Forget that
straunge nacyon to whom thu dedyst
ronne awaye and also the house of thyne
olde father, where thu hast dwelled so
longe. Than shall the kynge full of all
faythfulnesse, desyre thy bewtie. But
whan thu sawest that thy swete &amp; gracyouse
callynge, ded not profyte me, than begannyst
thu to crye lowder. Come vnto me
all yow whych are wearyly loaden with
laboure, for I am he that shall plenteously
refreshe yow and feade yow with my
breade of lyfe. Alas vnto all these swete

<p>For I doubted whether it were thu, or
els a fabyllouse writynge that so sayde.
For I was so folyshe, that without loue
I ded reade thy worde. I consydered not
wele the comparyson of the vyneyearde
whych brought fourth thornes &amp; bryers
in stede of good frute, that it sygnyfyed
me whych had so done. I knowe it wele
ynough, that whan thu dedyst call the
baren wyfe, saynge, Returne Sulamyte.
All thys dedyst thu speake that I, shulde
forsake my synne. And of all these wordes
ded I, as though I had vnderstande neuer
a whytt. But whan I ded peruse Hieremy
the prophete, I confesse that I had
in the readynge therof, feare in my harte
and bashefulnesse in my face. I wyll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[fol. 25]</span>
tell it, yea with teares in myne eyes, and
all for thy honoure, and to suppresse my

<p>The lawe doth consente to put her in
the hādes of iustyce, or to dryue her awaye
&amp; so neuer to se her or to take her agayne.
Thu hast made the sepracyon from my
bedde (sayth he vnto me) &amp; placed foren
louers in my roume, commyttynge with

mayst returne vnto me agayne. For I wyll

<p>But what dedyst thu than? Hast thu refused

hast excused me. Hast thu turned thy face
from me? No, for thyne eye so swete ded
penetrate my harte, woūdynge it almost

<p>O charyte most precyouse. I do se
wele that thy goodnesse doth consume
my lewdenesse, &amp; maketh me a newe godly
and bewtyfull creature. The euyll that
was myne, thu hast destroyed, and made
me so perfyght a creature, that all the
good whych a husbande can do vnto hys
wyfe thu hast done it to me, in geuynge
me, a faythfull Hope in thy promyses.
Now haue I through thy good grace recouered

&amp; desyered place, gracyuse bedde, trone
ryght honourable, seate of peace, rest from
all warre, hygh steppe of honoure, separate

<p>Alas what is thys? for I castynge myne

that my syght is wonderfull. Than am I
constrayned to loke downe, &amp; in so lokynge
downewarde, I do se what I am, and
what I was wyllynge to be. Alas I do
se in it, the lewdenesse, darkenesse, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[fol. 27]</span>
extreme depenesse of my euyll. My deathe
whych by hūblenesse closeth myne eye.
The admyrable goodnesse of the, &amp; the
vnspeakeable euyll whych is in me, Thy
ryght hyghnes &amp; pure maiestie, my ryght
fragyle and mortall nature, Thy gyftes,
goodes, &amp; beatytude, my malyce &amp; great
vnkyndnesse. O how good thu arte vnto
me, and how vnkynde am I to the? Thys
that thu wylte, and thys that I pursue.
Whych thynges consydered, causeth me

I my selfe to be the least thynge that
maye be compared vnto the, O loue, thu
madyst thys agrement whan thu dedyst
ioyne lyfe, and deathe togyther. But the
vnyon hath made alyue deathe. Lyfe dyenge,
and lyfe without ende, haue made our
deathe a lyfe. Deathe hath geuen vnto
lyfe a quyckenesse. Through suche deathe
I beynge dead, receyued lyfe, and by deathe
I am rauyshed with hym whych is
alyue. I lyue in the, and as for me, of my
selfe I am dead. And as cōcernynge the
bodyly deathe, it is nothynge els vnto me,
but a cōmynge out of pryson. Deathe is
lyfe vnto me. For through deathe, I am

<p>O what a goodly thynge it is to dye,
whych causeth my sowle to lyue. In delyuerynge
her frō thys mortall deathe, it exēpteth
her frō the deathe myserable, &amp;
matcheth her with a most myghty louer,
&amp; vnlesse she thus dyeth, she lāguyssheth
alwayes. Is not thā the sowle blameles,
whych wolde fayne dye for to haue suche
lyfe? Yes trulye, &amp; she ought to call deathe
her welbeloued, frynde O swete deathe,
plesaunt sorowe, myghty keye delyuerynge
from all wyckednesse. Those
whych trusted in the (o lorde) and in thy

trust in the, and in thy passyon. For with

vnto hym, whych whan he awaketh, doth
fynde through thy deathe, the lyfe euerlastynge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[fol. 28]</span>

<p>And the deathe whych is fearfull to

through thy deathe destroyed. Therfor
my God, if I were ryghtly taught, I
shulde call the deathe lyfe, and thys lyfe
deathe, ende of laboure, and begynnynge
of euerlastynge ioye. For I knowe that
the lōge lyfe doth lett me from thy syght.
O deathe, come, and breake the same obstacle
of lyfe. Or els loue, do a myracle
now, syth that I can not yet se my spouse.
Transfourme me with hym both bodye &amp;
sowle, and than shall I the better tarry
for the cummynge of deathe. Lete me dye
that I maye lyue with hym. For there is
nō that can helpe me, onles it be thu only.
O my sauer through. Faythe I am planted,
and ioyned with the. O what vnyon

sure of the. And I maye call the, father,

<p>O my father, what paternyte, O my

what dylectyon, O my spouse, what coniunctyon
is thys? Father full of humylyte,
Brother hauynge our symylytude, Sōne
engendered through faythe, &amp; loue, Husbande
louynge, and releuynge in all extremyte.
But whom doist thu loue? Alas it
is she whom thu hast withdrawen from
the snare, wherin, through malyce she
was bounde, and put her in place, name
and offyce of a doughter, syster, mother,

sauoure of swetnesse, ryght plesaūt, and
dylectable, whan a man, after the hearynge

feare, hys father, brother, chylde, &amp; spouse.
I in hearynge that worde, do perceyue

consume, and burne for loue.</p>

any profyte equall to thys? More ouer to
conclude it breuely. Is there any thynge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[fol. 29]</span>
that I coulde more ernestly loue? Alas
no. For he that vnfaynedly loueth God,
reputeth all these thynges worldly, of
lesse value than the dūge hylle. Pleasure
profyte, honoure of thys worlde, are all
but vayne tryfles vnto hym whych hath
founde God. Suche loue is so profytable,
honourable, &amp; abundaunt, that (I dare
saye) she only suffyseth the harte of a godly
man, and yeldeth hym so content, that
he neuer desyreth or wolde haue other.

<p>Now thanked by the lorde, through

Now haue I the my brother, for to socoure
my sorowes wherin I fynde non

feble age as an only staye. Now haue I
the a true, &amp; faythfull husbande, for the
satisfyenge of my whole harte. Now syth
that I haue the, I do forsake all them
that are in the worlde. Syth I holde the,
thu shalte escape me nomore. Seynge
that I se the, I wyll loke, vpon non other
thynge that myght kepe me backe from
the beholdynge of thy dyuynyte. Seynge
that I do heare the, I wyll heare nothynge
that letteth me frō the fruycyō of thy

the, I wyll cōmen with non other. Seynge
it pleaseth the to put me so nere the, I
wyll rather dye than to touche any other.
Seynge that I serue the, I wyll serue
non other master.</p>

<p>Seynge that thu hast ioyned thy harte

from thy loue is harder than is any
dampnacyon. I do not feare the payne of
ten thousande helles, so moche as I do
feare the ones losynge of the. Alas my
God, my father, and creator, do not suffer
that the enemy, inuentor of all synne, haue
suche power, that he make me to lese
thy presence. For who so euer hath once
felte the losse of thy loue, he shall saye that
he wolde rather be bounde for euer in helle,
than to feale the payne that one shall
haue by the losse of the same thy loue one
momente of tyme. O my sauer, do not permytt
that euer I departe from the. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[fol. 30]</span>
if it please the, put me in suche a place,
that my sowle through wantonnesse of

<p>In thys worlde I can not haue perfyghtly
thys my dsyre. Whych thynge
consydered maketh me feruently &amp; with
all my harte, to desyre the departynge
from thys bodye of synne, not fearynge
the deathe nor yet any of her instrumentes.
For what feare ought I to haue of my
God, whych through loue offered hymselfe
and suffered deathe, not of dett or dewtye,
but because he wolde for my only sake
vndo the power that mortall deathe had.
Now is Iesus dead, in whom we are all
dead, and through hys deathe he causeth
euery man to lyue agayne. I meane
those whych through faythe are partakers
of hys Passyon. For euen as the deathe
before the great mystery of the crosse,
was harde to euery bodye, and there was
no mā but was feared therwith, consyderynge
the copulacyon of the bodye &amp; the
sowle, their order, loue, and agrement,
so were their sorowes extreme in the departynge
of the one from the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sapi. 3.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1. Ioā. 4.</div>

<p>But sens it hath pleased the swete lambe
to offer hymselfe vpon the crosse, hys
great loue hath kyndeled a fyre within
the harte so vehement, that euery true
beleuer estemeth the passage of deathe
but a playe or pastyme, and so preuoketh
other constauntly in hys truthe to dye.
And euē as the feare of deathe ded retarde
vs, so ought loue to gyue vs a desyre to
dye. For if true loue be vnfaynedly within
the harte of a man, he can fele non other
thynge, because that loue is so stronge of
itselfe, that she kepith all the roume, and
putteth out all other desyres, not sufferynge
any thynge there but God only. For
whersoeuer true and perfyght loue is, we
do neyther remēbre feare nor yet sorowe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deute. 16.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Eccle. 1.</div>

<p>If our owne pryde for to attayne honoure,
maketh vs to seke deathe so manye straunge
wayes. As if for to haue a folysh
pleasure, a man putteth hym selfe in ieopardye
of lyfe. If a merchaūte to obtayne
ryches, doth daunger hymselfe, somtyme
for the value of a shyllynge. If the first
cōceyuynge of robery or murther, crueltie
or deceyte, doth so blynde a man, that he
doubteth nothynge the daunger of deathe,
neyther yet mysfortune whan he seketh
to auēge hymselfe or doth any other
euyll. If the fury of syckenesse or the rankenesse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[fol. 31]</span>
of Melancholy causeth a creature
fearcely to wyshe for deathe, &amp; oft tymes
to drowne, hāge, or kylle thēselues.
For suche euyls are somtymes so great
that they cause their payned pacyentes
to chose deathe for lyberte. If it so be than
that these paynes full of euyll, and imperfectyons,
causeth them not to feare the
hasarde of deathe, but rather to thynke
that deathe tarryeth to longe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roma. 8[unclear].</div>

<p>Alas what ought true and laudable

eternall creatour to wyshe? Shulde she
sturre a harte suche wyse, that he beynge
transported with suche affectyon, shulde
fele non other thynge in hym? Alas yea.
For deathe is a plesaunt thynge to the
sowle, whych is in loue with God, and
estemeth the passage easye, through the
whych she commyth out of pryson. For
the harde waye, wherthrough she commeth,
can not wearye her for to enbrace

the same deathe, through whom we shall

O deathe where is thy stynge and darte?
Alas they are bannyshed from myne

<p>Than I perceyue to haue non other accuser
but Iesus Christ, whych is my redemer,
whose deathe hath restored vs our
lost inherytaunce. For he made hym selfe
our man of lawe, shewynge hys so worthye

great debte is so habundauntly recōpenced,
that in iudgement it is accompted for
nothynge. O redemer, here is a great loue?
We fynde but fewe suche mē of lawe.
Swete Iesus Christ, it is vnto the that I
am a detter, yet dost thu both praye, and
speake for me. And moreouer whan thu
dost se that I am poore, with the abūdaūce
of thy goodes thu dost paye my debte.
O incomprehensyble see of all goodnesse.
O my father, dost thu vouchesaue to be
my iudge, not wyllynge the deathe of a
synner? O Iesus Christ, true fysher, and
sauer of the sowle, frynde aboue all fryndes.
For thu beynge my man of lawe dedyst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[fol. 33]</span>

<p>I feare nomore to be vndone by any man
for the lawe is satisfyed by the for all. My
swete spouse hath made the payment so
habundaunt, that the lawe can aske nothynge
of me but is payed of hym. For as
I beleue, he hath taken all my synnes vpō
hym, and hath geuē me in place of them,
hys owne goodes in habundaunce. O my
sauer, presentynge thy vertues, thu dost
content the lawe. Whan she wyll reproche
me of my synnes, thu dost shewe her
how willyngly in thyne owne fleshe, thu
hast taken the dyscharge of thē, through
the coniunctyon of our marryage. Also
vpon the crosse through thy passyon, thu
hast made satisfactyon for it. Moreouer
thy only charyte hath geuē me thys, that
thu hast for me deserued. Therfor seynge
thy meryte to be myne, the lawe can aske
nothynge of me. Than wyll I feare nomore
the iudgement, but with desyre rather
than parforce, I do tarry for the tyme
that I shall se my iudge, and heare a iust
iudgemente of hym.</p>

<p>Yet I knowe that thy iudgemēte
is so iust, that there is no faulte therin, &amp;
that my infydelyte is worthye to suffer
the cruelnesse of helle. For if I do only
consydre my deseruynge, I can se nothynge
in it that can keape me from the fyre
of helle. True it is, that the torment of
helle was neuer prepared but for the deuyll,
and not for reasonable men. Neuerthelesse
if any man haue set in hys mynde
to be lyke to the deuyll, than ought he as
the deuyll to be payed with a lyke rewarde.
But if a man through cōtemplacyon

he is sure to obtayne heauen, whych is a

I am so lyke in my doynges, and so accustomed
in hys wayes, that of hys payne
&amp; tormente I ought to be partaker. For
the cruell synne whych hath bounde me
in helle, is so great and hys force so stronge,
that it leteth nothynge to come from
it, neyther feareth it the cōtrary assaulte
of any man. But he whych is in thys kynde

euer yet vanquyshe that helle, saue only
he whych ded the great assaulte through
hys vnspeakable charyte, whan he humbled

hath ouercomen hys enemye, broken helle

in the great strength that he
hath, I do not set by helle and synne, No
not so moche as a strawe. So that synne
can neuer haue holde of me, vnlesse it be

<p>Therfor helle hath not had all the nomber
that he did pretende to haue, bicause
that the solacyouse shaddowe &amp; power
of hys passyon, is suche a myghtye protectyon
to the sowle, that she therby nedeth
neyther to doubte deathe, synne, nor helle.
Is there anye thynge can pull me backe
if God be wyllynge through hys gyfte
of faythe to drawe me to hym? I meane
suche faythe as we must nedes haue to
obtayne the hygh graces from aboue, &amp;
also suche faythe as through charyte doth
ioyne the humble seruaunt to hys maker.
I beynge ioyned vnto hym, ought to haue
no feare of trauayle, payne, nor sorowe.
For who so euer doth wyllyngly suffer
anye maner of deathe or sorowe for the

<div class="sidenote">Roma. 8.</div>

<p>Through hys confort I maye do all
thynges. For hys loue is so cōstaūt &amp; permanēt
that it varyeth not for anye worldly
thynge. Who can thā withdrawe me
from hys grace? Surely the great heyth
of heauen, nor the deapenesse of helle, nor
the breadeth of the whole earthe, neyther
deathe nor synne, whych doth warre euery
daye agaynst me, can separate me one mynute
from the great loue &amp; charyte, that
my heauenly father through Iesus Christ
hath vnto me. Hys goodnesse is suche, that
he loueth me whych haue not at all tymes
loued hym. And if I now loue hym, than
shall I feale hys loue to increase in me.
But bycause that my loue is not worthy
to loue hym, I desyre hys loue to be myne
the whych I feale suche as though it were
myne owne. Hys desyre is to loue, and
through hys loue he causith my harte to
be inflamyd with loue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roma. 11.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ephe. 2[unclear].</div>

<p>And through suche loue he fyndeth hym
selfe so welbeloued, that hys owne dede
yeldeth hym wele content, &amp; not my loue
or strengthe. Contentynge hys selfe, hys
loue doth increase more in me, than I can
of hym desyre, O true louer, fountayne, or
welsprynge of all charyte, and only purse
of the heauēly treasure. Ought I to thynke,
or dare I saye what thu art? Maye I
write it, or can anye mortall man comprehende
thys goodnesse &amp; loue? And if thu
prēte in anye mānys harte, cā he expresse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[fol. 36]</span>
it? No surely. For the capacyte of no man
can comprehende the vnmesurable goodnesses
whych are in the, for naturall reasō
doth shewe vs how there is no cōparyson
betwyne an eternall &amp; a mortall thynge.
But whan through loue the mortall is
ioyned with the eternall, the mortall thynge
is so fulfylled with the eternall, that
it can not fynde the ende therof. For it
hath in it more good therby, than it can
contayne or holde.</p>

<p>Therfor doth a man thynke, whych hath
the loue of God, that he hath all the goodes
in the worlde therwith. Euen as we
se the sūne with one only sparcle of hys
lyght doth blynde the eye, and yet doth
she witholde her great lyghte. But aske
the eye what he hath seane, and he wyll
saye that he hath beholden the whole
bryghtnesse of the sunne. But that is a
great lye. For he beynge dymmed with a
lytle sparcle, coulde not se the whole cleartye
therof. And neuertheles he is so
contente, that it semith vnto hym as
though he had so moche lyght as the sunne
contayneth. Yet if he had more than
the seyde sparcle, he were not able to suffer
it. Euen so the sowle whych through
faythe doth fele one sparcle of the loue
of God, doth fynde therwith the heate
so great and maruelouse, so swete and
delycyouse, that it is impossyble to her to
declare what thynge the same loue is.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Phil. 1.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1. Ioā. 4.</div>

<p>For a lytle threof that she hath felte
doth yelde her mynde satisfyed &amp; desyerynge
of more wherof she hath ynough.
So doth she lyue languyshynge &amp; syghynge.
The harte doth fele wele, that he
hath receyued to moche, but he hath cōceyued
suche desyre in thys to moche, that
he alwayes desyerith to receyue the thynge
whych he can not haue, neyther is he
worthye to receyue it. He knowith the
good that he hath alredy to be vnspeakeable,
and yet wolde he haue more of that
wherof he can not stylle. Truly he can
not fele or thynke the good whych is in
hym. Then lyeth it not in my power, to tell
what thynge the loue of God is, sith that
I haue no knowlege of the feruentnesse
therof. He that thynketh to haue all thys
loue withyn hys harte, can not truly declare

with all kyndes of languages, lernynges,

were euydence stronge ynough, if I had
not els to laye for the matter. But marke
yet an other moch more effectuall and clere,
at the whych not a fewe lerned men in
Germany haue wondered. In .iiij. noble
languages, Latyne, Greke, Frenche, and
Italyane, wrote she vnto me these clauses
folowynge. Whych I haue added to thys
boke, not only in commendacyon of her lerned
youth, but also as an example to be folowed
of other noble men and women, cōcernynge
their chyldren. The written clauses
are these, whych she wrote first with
her owne hande, moch more fynely than I
coulde with anye prentynge letter set thē

Apothegmes, or breue and quyck sētences,

come from women. I haue serched
Plutarchus, Boccatius, Bergomas, Textor,
&amp; Lander of Bonony, whych all wrote
of the vertues and worthy actes of womē.
But amonge them all haue I founde no
counsels so necessary to the cōmen welthe
of our christyanyte. I denye it not, but excellent
thynges they vttered, and matters
of wysdome wonderfull, concernynge morall
vertues. But these most hyghly respecteth
the kyngedome of fayth and regymēt
of the sowle, whych Iesus Christ the eternall
sonne of God, from heauen by hys doctryne

Many graue sentences had they concernynge

these are for all sortes of people, hygh, lowe,

<p>No realme vndre the skye hath had more
noble women, nor of more excellent graces,
than haue thys realme of Englande,
both in the dayes of the Brytaynes, and
sens the Englysh Saxons obtayned it by
valeaunt conquest. Guendolena the wyfe
of Locrinus the seconde kynge of Brytayne,
beynge vnlaufully dyuorced from hym
for the pleasure of an whore, whom he longe
afore had kepte, tryed it with hym by
dynte of the swerde, had the vyctory, and
reigned after hym as kynge the space of .xv.
yeares, tyll her sonne Maddan come
to laufull age. Cordilla the doughter of
kynge Leyer, and least of all her systers, as
her father was deposed, &amp; exyled out of
hys lande, she receyued, conforted, and restored
hym agayne to hys princely honoure,
and reigned alone after hys deathe, for
the space of .v. yeares. Cambra the doughter
of kynge Belyne, and wyfe to Antenor
than Kynge of France, ded not only excede
in bewtie, but also in wysdome. In so
moch that she first instructed the noble
men how to buylde cyties, castels, and other
stronge holdes, the cōmē people more
comely maners, and the womē a most semely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[fol. 43]</span>
deckynge of their heades. She made
their cyuyle lawes, whych vpon her name
were called. Leges Sycambrorum. She
taught them to sowe flaxe and hempe, to
watter it, drye it, dresse it, spynne it, weaue

<p>Martia the wyfe of kynge Guythelyne,
a lady excedyngly fayre, wyse, &amp; lerned
in all the lyberall scyences, inuented
thynges wonderfull by the hygh practyse
of her wytt. After the death of her husbāde
she reigned .vij. yeares as kynge, tyll
Sicilius her sonne came to age. She redressed
the commen welthe, refourmed
the grosse maners of the people, and made
most honest lawes, called of her name, Leges
Martiane. So delyghted the Frenche
kynge Nicanor in the wysdome, lernynge,
and comely maners of hys wyfe Constantia,
the doughter of kynge Eliodorus, that
he not only holpe her brother Geruntius
in see battayle agaynst the kynge of Orchades,
but also sent hys most dere sonne Priamus
into Brytayne to haue the same selfe
bryngynge vp. The Scottysh kynge Finnanus,
thought hys pryncely honour most
gloryously increased, as he had obtayned
Agasia the doughter of kynge Blegabridus,
to be coupled in maryage with Dorstus
hys sonne, for the manyfolde graces
that he behelde in her. What though the
seyd vngracyouse Dorstus, in spyght of the
Brytaynes, ded afterwarde vse her most
wyckedly. Bundwyca a womā both hygh
of stature, and stomacke, also of myst noble
lynage amonge the Brytaynes, perceyuynge
the hauoke whych the Romanes
dayly made in the lande, with great pusaunce
of worthy warryours she inuaded
them, slewe them, hynge vp their captaynes,
and folowed the remnaunt of them to

and .v. thousande women more of the Britannysh
bloude in battayle agaynst the
furyouse fearce Romanes, to suppresse their

But as she behelde the vyctory vpon their

the Brytanes entered into the yle of Māne,
and in a nyght battayle, there slewe thē
in a wonderfull nombre, destroyenge their
fortalyces, and holdes. Notwithstandynge
at the lattre beynge taken, she was byheaded,
her eldar syster beynge maryed to kynge
Marius. Athildis the doughter of
the seyd kynge Marius, was also a most
noble woman, whom the Frenche kynge
Marcomerus marryed for the only naturall
gyftes and scyences whych she had
aboue other women, and had .vij. sonnes
by her. Claudia Rufina, a noble Brytayne,
wyttye and lerned both in Greke and Latyne,
hauynge to husbande one Aulus
Rufus a lerned knyght, a poete of Bonony
&amp; a phylosopher of the Stoycall sort, is

<p>Emerita the syster of kynge Lucius,
whych is called the first christened kynge,
a lady most vertuouse and faythfull for cōstauntly
affermynge the veryte of Christ,
suffered most tyrannouse death and was
brent in the fyre. Helena Flauia, the
doughter of kynge Coelus, and mother to
great Constantyne the Emprour, was a
woman of incomparable bewtie and lernynge.
Non coulde be founde lyke her in
the artes lyberall, neyther yet in the fyne
handelynge of all instrumentes of musyke.
She excelled all other in the dyuerse speches
of nacyons, specyally in the Latyne,
Greke, and Hebrue. She made a boke of
the prouydence of God, an other of the immortalyte
of the sowle, with serten Greke
poemes, epystles, and dyuerse other treatyses.
Constantia her doughter, was also
a woman of most excellent giftes, had
she not in the ende declyned to the detestable
secte of the Arryanes, by serten hypocrytysh
prestes. Vrsula Cynosura, the
floryshynge douter of Dionothus the duke
of Cornewale, was so nobylly brougt vp in
all lyberall dyscyplyne, that Conanus the
kynge of lytle Brytayne desyred her to wyfe,

syster of kynge Arthure, are of writers
magnyfyed, for their dyuerse and excellent
graces. Morganis a woman of incomparable
loue towardes her parentes, and
contraye, so secretly and wysely conuayed
the body of kynge Arthure, the most worthy
gouernour of the Brytaynes, that the
Englysh Saxons coulde neuer come to it,
to do their vyolēce theron. Hermelinda,
rysynge of the Englysh Saxons bloude,
for her excellent bewtie and noble behauer
became the wyfe of Cunibertus the kynge
of Lombardy. Hylda, a noble woman,
both godly, wyse, and lerned, not only dysputed

a Frenche man, the busyest amonge them.
The thre doughters of kynge Alphrede,
Elfleda, Elfritha, and Ethelgora, were
wonderfully experte in the lyberall scyences.

to kynge wyllyam of Cycyll, she caused
her father to sende ouer .ij. lerned men of
Englande, walther and Rycharde with
a French doctour called Petrus Blesensis
to instruct hym in them, specyally in the
arte of versyfyenge. And at her cōmynge
thydre, the one of those Englysh men was
made archebyshop of Panorme, &amp; the other
byshop of Siracusa, in recompēce of their
labours. Margarete the noble mother
of kynge Henry the .vij. so plenteously mynded
the preferment of scyences &amp; goynge
forewarde of lernynges, that she buylded
in Cambryge for the same porpose, the colleges
of Christ &amp; of S. Iohan the Euāgelyst,
and gaue landes for their mayntenaunce,
as quene Helisabeth ded afore, to
the quenes college there. Longe were it

or realme of Englande, haue excelled
in bewtie, wytte, wysdome, scyence lāguages,
lyberalyte, polycyes, heroycall force,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[fol. 46]</span>
and soch other notable vertues, and by

Eyther yet to sort out their Names and
regestre them one by one, whych haue bene
marryed out of the same, to Emprours,

whych had these aforenamed vertues syngle,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
